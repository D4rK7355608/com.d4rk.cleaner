# How it works

Cleaner scans your device for junk files, cache, and other unwanted data. It then gives you the option to remove these files, or to add them to a whitelist so that they are not removed in the future. You can also schedule Cleaner to run automatically on a daily basis, so you can keep your device clean and running smoothly without any effort.
